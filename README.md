# Previous Projects
These are different examples of projects that I have previously worked on.
## Project 1
This program is designed to take in a postfix expression string made up of whole numbers and expression operators such as "+,-,/,*,^". Using a stack the program takes the string and converts it from a postfix expression ("2 4 ^ 3 + 2 5 / -") to an infix expression ((2^4)+3-2/5) and uses that expression to get a result (18.6).
## Project 2
This program allows the user to create linked lists using nodes. The linked lists are able to be modified with the several functions that are available to the user such as add,remove,insert,append,and pop. There are also informational functions such as search,isEmpty.
## Project 3
This program is allows the user to create queues using nodes. The user is able to dequeue and enqueue nodes into a list.
## Project 4
Using the principal concepts of object-oriented programming such as inheritance and polymorphism, this program creates a virtual simulation of a bank. The bank includes different features that banks offer. These features are accessed by customers or employees. Certain employees cannot access important features.
## Project 5
Project5.py includes a function that checks if the entered variable is palindrome and returns the result. Project5test.py tests the code using Python's unittest. The test makes certain that the function does not return an error.
